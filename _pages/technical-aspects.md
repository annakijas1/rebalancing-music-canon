### How was this built?
This website is hosted on GitHub pages and built in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/ed/" target="_blank">Ed</a>, and <a href="https://teic.github.io/CETEIcean/" target="_blank">CETEIcean</a>. The text on this site is written in Markdown while the music incipits are encoded in <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/" target="_blank">MEI XML</a> and rendered in the browser with <a href="https://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml" target="_blank">Verovio</a>, a music notation engraving library.

Each incipit was transcribed by contributers using the open-source notation software, <a href="https://musescore.org/en" target="_blank">MuseScore</a>. Following review, incipits were exported as MusicXML and then transformed into MEI XML with the <a href="https://editor.verovio.org/" target="_blank">Verovio Editor</a> tool. Although the incipits undergo review, we do not guarantee that they are completely free from mistakes. If you find errors, please create an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/annakijas1/rebalancing-music-canon/issues">Issues Page</a> and we will make an effort to address or correct it.
