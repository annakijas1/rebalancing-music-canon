The index is under development and additional composers and works will be added. Details about this project are available on this [page](https://annakijas1.github.io/rebalancing-music-canon/about/). Incipits are transcribed from scores housed in the Lilly Music Library, unless otherwise noted. Incipits are being added regularly and there may be titles in the index that do not yet have a corresponding incipit.
